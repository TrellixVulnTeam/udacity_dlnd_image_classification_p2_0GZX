# udacity_dlnd_image_classification_p2
## Udacuty foundations to machine learning course, second project

In this project, you'll classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. You'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.
